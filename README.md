# teamProfile-generator
A command line application that enables users to input informations in regards to their employees and generate an HTML page that displays relevant informations of each memeber on a team of developers. This application relies heavily on the concept of Object orient programming (OOP), this case being classes: Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern. These classes later going under unit testings to ensure correctness of JS codebase through the use of Jest.
